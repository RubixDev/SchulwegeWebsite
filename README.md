# SchulwegeWebsite
## Context
This website was created during a project week from the 21.06.2021 until 25.06.2021 on our school.
Each group of about four school students was accompanied and supervised by one student of the University in Wuppertal.
The general theme was "sustainable mobility" in which we concentrated on the ways to school and the risks and problems thereof.

**It is entirely in german, as it was made in a german school for a german project.**
